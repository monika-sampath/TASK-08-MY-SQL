-- 2. FROM Clause
-- customers c: The customers table, aliased as c.
-- JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id: Combines customers and orders tables by matching c.id with o.customer_id.
-- 3. GROUP BY Clause
-- c.id, c.name: Groups the data by customer ID and name so the SUM is calculated for each customer.
